# FlagPredictorBot
This is a GUI based project working on Python with Machine Learning to predict any country flag among top 196 countries asking some basic details regarding it. 
This project I actually made 3 months ago when I was not aware of better algorithms like Random Forest and Dimensionality reduction algorithms so couldn't implement it back then on GUI. Personally now when I am aware of Boosting algorithms, I think they would have work better on this problem with less features resulting in less questions.
